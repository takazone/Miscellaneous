browser.maximize_window() #Maximize the window
browser.get('https://academico.pecege.org.br/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f') #any website you wish to acess

#Allows time for webpage to load (Depends of how fast is your computer and also the internet)

pg.click(x=1042, y=341)
pp.copy("youremail.com")
pg.hotkey("ctrl", "v")

pg.click(x=911, y=415)
pp.copy("password")
pg.hotkey("ctrl", "v")

pg.click(x=1197, y=542) #last click on the login button


####### Finding the coordinates#####

#Notes: The coordinates depends of the size of your screen and also if the browser is maximized or not. To find it, youll need to run the following code:

time.sleep(5)
ff = pyautogui.position() #put the mouse on the place you want to locate the coordinates, it is not needed to click. Wait for the sleep time to end.
print(ff) #if you're using Vs Code, don't forget the print function, otherwise it will not show. For jupyter notebooks it is not needed.
